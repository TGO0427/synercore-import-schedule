## 4. Data Model & Business Rules

### 4.1 Shipment Lifecycle

**State Transitions:**
```
Planned → In Transit → Arrived → Unloading → Inspection → Receiving → Stored
                                    ↓
                                 Rejected/Returned
```

**Business Rules:**
1. Planned shipments appear at bottom of schedule by default
2. Week number is required for capacity planning
3. Pallet quantity is required for warehouse capacity calculations
4. Air customs clearance is considered "incoming" for capacity planning
5. Stored shipments are excluded from incoming capacity calculations
6. Inspection must complete before receiving can begin
7. Failed inspections can trigger rejection workflow
8. Archived shipments are read-only

### 4.2 Warehouse Capacity

**Calculations:**
- **Items per Bin:** 12.5 pallets per bin (configurable)
- **Projected Bins:** Current Bins + (Incoming Pallets / Items per Bin)
- **Utilization %:** (Projected Bins / Total Bins) × 100
- **Available Bins:** Total Bins - Projected Bins

**Status Thresholds:**
- **Good:** 50-75% utilization
- **Warning:** 75-90% utilization
- **Critical:** 90-100% utilization
- **Over Capacity:** >100% utilization

**Incoming Logic:**
- Include: planned_airfreight, planned_seafreight, in_transit_airfreight, air_customs_clearance, in_transit_roadway, in_transit_seaway
- Exclude: arrived_*, inspecting, inspection_*, receiving, received, stored, cancelled, delayed
- Filter: Current month only (based on week number)

### 4.3 User Roles & Permissions

**Admin:**
- Full CRUD on all resources
- User management
- System configuration
- Archive management
- Delete permanently

**User:**
- View all shipments
- Create/edit shipments
- Manage workflows
- Generate reports
- Update own profile
- Cannot delete users
- Cannot access user management

### 4.4 Audit Trail

**Tracked Changes:**
- Warehouse capacity changes (full history)
- Shipment status changes (via updated_at)
- User actions (inspected_by, received_by, updated_by)
- Timestamps on all critical operations

**Retention:**
- Warehouse capacity history: Indefinite
- Shipment history: Indefinite
- Archived shipments: Indefinite
- User sessions: 24 hours (JWT expiration)
